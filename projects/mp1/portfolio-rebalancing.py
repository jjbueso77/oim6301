    # Mini Project 1

    Your choice of option, what each one asks for, the due date and how it is graded are on the Mini Project 1 page of the course site, linked from the calendar. This notebook is the shape to build it in. Keep the headings, and replace each line in italics with your own.

    Save it in your course repository as `projects/mp1/<your-tool>.py`, named for what it does, such as `loan-schedule.py`, and open it with `uv run marimo edit`.

    ## 2. My Plan Before AI

    *Before you ask your agent anything, write how you would solve it: the steps, in order, in plain words, in five lines or more. Then answer these two questions:*

    - *What does your loop carry from one step to the next, the way a running total carries its sum?*
    - *Which check will you use in section 6, and which two numbers should agree?*

    *Commit this notebook with the message `mp1: plan before AI`.*

    First, I would calculate how much each stock is worth by multiplying the number of shares by its price.

    Then, I would add everything together, including the cash, to find the total value of the portfolio.

    Next, I would use the target percentages to figure out how much money should be invested in each stock.

    After that, I would calculate how many whole shares I should have and compare that to what I currently own.

    I would then figure out which stocks I need to buy or sell and how much cash I have left.

    Finally, I would check how close the new portfolio is to the target percentages.

    1. What does my loop carry from one step to the next?

    The loop would go through each stock one at a time and keep adding its value to a running total. Later, I would use a loop to calculate the shares needed for each stock.

    2. Which check will I use in Section 6?

    I would compare the total portfolio value before and after rebalancing. Since there are no trading fees, both numbers should be the same. This would help me check that my calculations are correct.

    Every number the project starts from goes in the cell below, and nowhere else, so that changing one input changes every result after it.

    Copy in the default inputs for your option from the Mini Project 1 page. If you chose D, your own option, type your data in here, or ask your agent to generate it with `faker`. The required part reads no file.
